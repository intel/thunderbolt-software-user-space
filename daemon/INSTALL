Prerequisites
=============
To compile the Thunderbolt Daemon you will need these packages and libraries installed:
1. Kernel with supported Thunderbolt module (https://github.com/01org/thunderbolt-software-kernel-tree/tree/networking) 
2. g++ compiler (with c++11 support, tested with g++ 4.8.2)
3. CMake >= 2.8.8 (http://www.cmake.org/)
4. libnl 3 (http://www.infradead.org/~tgr/libnl/ or development
   packages from the distribution repositories, tested with libnl3-3.2.21-6))
5. libdbus-c++ >= 0.5.0 (http://dbus-cplusplus.sourceforge.net/ or development packages from the distribution repositories)

Basic Installation
==================
The CMake command tries to find necessary libraries and system paths.
Upon success, it will create Makefile which then can be compiled and installed using the make command.

The simplest way to compile and install the Thunderbolt Daemon is:
1. cd to 'ThunderboltService'
2. Create a directory named e.g. 'build'
3. Run 'cmake ../Linux'
4. Run 'make'
5. Run 'sudo make install'
