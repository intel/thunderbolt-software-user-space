+Intel Thunderbolt(TM) Linux driver
+==================================
+
+Copyright(c) 2013 - 2016 Intel Corporation.
+
+Contact Information:
+Intel Thunderbolt mailing list <thunderbolt-software@lists.01.org>
+Edited by Michael Jamet <michael.jamet@intel.com>
+
+Overview
+========
+ 
+Thunderbolt(TM) Networking mode is introduced with this driver.
+This kernel code creates an ethernet device utilized in computer to computer
+communication over a Thunderbolt cable.
+This driver has been added on the top of the existing thunderbolt driver 
+for systems with firwmare (FW) based Thunderbolt controllers supporting
+Thunderbolt Networking.
+
+Files
+=====
+
+- icm_nhi.c/h:	These files allow communication with the FW (a.k.a ICM) based controller.
+	      	In addition, they create an interface for netlink communication with 
+	      	a user space daemon.
+
+- net.c/net.h:	These files implement the 'eth' interface for the Thunderbolt(TM) 
+		networking.  
+ 
+Interface to user space
+=======================
+
+The interface to the user space module is implemented through a Generic Netlink. 
+In order to be accessed by the user space module, both kernel and user space 
+modules have to register with the same GENL_NAME. In our case, this is 
+simply "thunderbolt". 
+The registration is done at driver initialization time for all instances of 
+the Thunderbolt controllers.  
+The communication is then carried through pre-defined Thunderbolt messages. 
+Each specific message has a callback function that is called when 
+the related message is received. 
+
+The messages are defined as follows:
+* NHI_CMD_UNSPEC: Not used.
+* NHI_CMD_SUBSCRIBE: Subscription request from daemon to driver to open the
+  communication channel. 
+* NHI_CMD_UNSUBSCRIBE: Request from daemon to driver to unsubscribe  
+  to close communication channel.
+* NHI_CMD_QUERY_INFORMATION: Request information from the driver such as 
+  driver version, FW version offset, number of ports in the controller
+  and DMA port.
+* NHI_CMD_MSG_TO_ICM: Message from user space module to FW.
+* NHI_CMD_MSG_FROM_ICM: Response from FW to user space module.
+* NHI_CMD_MAILBOX: Message that uses mailbox mechanism such as FW policy 
+  changes or disconnect path.
+* NHI_CMD_APPROVE_TBT_NETWORKING: Request from user space 
+  module to FW to establish path.
+* NHI_CMD_ICM_IN_SAFE_MODE: Indication that the FW has entered safe mode. 
+
+Communication with ICM (Firmware)
+=================================
+
+The communication with ICM is principally achieved through 
+a DMA mechanism on Ring 0.
+The driver allocates a shared memory that is physically mapped onto 
+the DMA physical space at Ring 0. 
+
+Interrupts
+==========
+
+Thunderbolt relies on MSI-X interrupts. 
+The MSI-X vector is allocated as follows:
+ICM
+     - Tx: MSI-X vector index 0
+     - Rx: MSI-X vector index 1
+
+Port 0
+     - Tx: MSI-X vector index 2
+     - Rx: MSI-X vector index 3
+
+Port 1
+     - Tx: MSI-X vector index 4
+     - Rx: MSI-X vector index 5
+
+ICM interrupts are used for communication with ICM only. 
+Port 0 and Port 1 interrupts are used for Thunderbolt Networking 
+communications. 
+In case MSI-X is not available, the driver requests to enable MSI only.
+
+Mutexes, semaphores and spinlocks
+================================= 
+
+The driver should be able to operate in an environment where hardware
+is asynchronously accessed by multiple entities such as netlink,
+multiple controllers etc.  
+
+* send_sem: This semaphore enforces unique sender (one sender at a time) 
+  to avoid wrong impairing with responses. FW may process one message 
+  at the time. 
+* d0_exit_send_mutex: This mutex protects D0 exit (D3) situation 
+  to avoid continuing to send messages to FW.
+* d0_exit_mailbox_mutex: This mutex protects D0 exit (D3) situation to
+  avoid continuing to send commands to mailbox. 
+* mailbox_mutex: This mutex enforces unique sender (one sender at a time) 
+  for the mailbox command. 
+  A mutex is sufficient since the mailbox mechanism uses a polling mechanism
+  to get the command response.
+* lock: This spinlock protects from simultaneous changes during 
+  disable/enable interrupts.
+* state_lock: This mutex comes to protect changes during net device state 
+  changes and net_device operations. 
+* controllers_list_rwsem: This read/write sempahore syncs the access to 
+  the controllers list when there are multiple controllers in the system.
+
+FW path enablement 
+==================
+
+In order to SW to communicate with the FW, the driver needs to send to FW 
+the PDF driver ready command and receive response from FW. 
+The driver ready command PDF value is 12 and the response is 13.
+Once the exchange is completed, the user space module should be able to send 
+messages through the driver to the FW and FW starts to send notifications
+about HW/FW events.
